# Trio Structured Concurrency Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of structured concurrency using Trio for the API server's video generation workers. The implementation provides efficient resource management, proper cancellation handling, and subprocess management with signal handling.

## Requirements Implemented

### Requirement 6.1: Structured Task Groups and Cancellation Scopes
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: The system uses Trio's structured task groups and cancellation scopes for proper resource management.

**Key Components:**
- `TrioCancellationToken`: Manages cancellation state with proper cleanup callbacks
- `TrioJobExecutor`: Executes jobs within structured nurseries with cancellation scopes
- `trio_job_context`: Context manager for structured job execution with automatic cleanup

### Requirement 6.2: SIGTERM/SIGKILL Process Management
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: The system sends SIGTERM to child processes and escalates to SIGKILL if needed.

**Key Components:**
- `ProcessManager`: Manages subprocess lifecycle with graceful termination
- `_terminate_process()`: Implements SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation pattern
- `start_process()`: Monitors processes with cancellation support and timeout handling

### Requirement 6.3: Cleanup and Status Management
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: The system cleans up temporary files and updates job status to "canceled" on cancellation.

**Key Components:**
- `cleanup_temp_files_async()`: Async cleanup of temporary directories
- `check_cancellation_async()`: Updates job status to CANCELED when cancellation is detected
- Cleanup callbacks: Automatic resource cleanup on job completion or cancellation

### Requirement 6.4: Asyncio Fallback Mechanisms
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: The system provides fallback mechanisms for asyncio dependencies.

**Key Components:**
- `AsyncioTrioBridge`: Runs asyncio code within Trio context using thread pools
- Fallback to threading-based execution when Trio is unavailable
- Graceful degradation with proper error handling and logging

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Trio Executor (`workers/trio_executor.py`)
- **TrioCancellationToken**: Cooperative cancellation with cleanup callbacks
- **ProcessManager**: Subprocess management with signal handling
- **TrioJobExecutor**: Main executor with structured concurrency
- **AsyncioTrioBridge**: Fallback mechanism for asyncio dependencies

#### 2. Trio Video Worker (`workers/trio_video_worker.py`)
- **process_video_job_trio()**: Main Trio-based job processor
- **execute_pipeline_with_trio()**: Pipeline execution with structured concurrency
- Phase-based execution with cancellation checks at each phase
- Async wrappers for all pipeline components

#### 3. Enhanced Video Worker (`workers/video_worker.py`)
- **process_video_job()**: Main entry point with Trio/threading selection
- **process_video_job_threading()**: Fallback threading implementation
- Automatic fallback when Trio execution fails
- Integration with existing RQ job queue system

#### 4. Queue Integration (`api/queue.py`)
- Enhanced `cancel_job()` method supports both Trio and threading cancellation
- Proper integration with both cancellation mechanisms
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing queue operations

### Structured Concurrency Features

#### Task Groups and Nurseries
```python
async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:
    # All tasks in this nursery are managed together
    nursery.start_soon(task1)
    nursery.start_soon(task2)
    # Nursery ensures all tasks complete or are cancelled together
```

#### Cancellation Scopes
```python
with trio.CancelScope() as cancel_scope:
    cancellation_token = TrioCancellationToken(job_id, cancel_scope)
    # Cancellation propagates through the entire scope
    await execute_job_with_cancellation(cancellation_token)
```

#### Resource Management
```python
async with trio_job_context(job_id) as (token, manager):
    token.add_cleanup_callback(cleanup_function)
    # Cleanup automatically called on exit
```

## Process Management

### Signal Handling Implementation
The system implements proper SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation:

1. **SIGTERM**: Sent first for graceful shutdown (5-second timeout)
2. **SIGKILL**: Sent if process doesn't terminate gracefully (2-second timeout)
3. **Cleanup**: Process resources are cleaned up regardless of termination method

### Subprocess Monitoring
- Continuous monitoring of subprocess status
- Cancellation checks during process execution
- Timeout handling with proper cleanup
- Process tracking for bulk termination

## Cancellation Handling

### Cooperative Cancellation
- Jobs check cancellation status at regular intervals
- Cancellation tokens propagate through all job phases
- Proper cleanup callbacks ensure resource deallocation
- Job status updated to CANCELED in queue system

### Cleanup Mechanisms
- Temporary file cleanup using async operations
- Process termination with signal escalation
- Resource deallocation through cleanup callbacks
- Proper error handling during cleanup operations

## Fallback Mechanisms

### Trio Availability Detection
```python
try:
    import trio
    TRIO_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    TRIO_AVAILABLE = False
```

### Automatic Fallback
- Trio execution attempted first when available
- Automatic fallback to threading on Trio failure
- Graceful degradation with proper logging
- Maintains full functionality in both modes

### Asyncio Bridge
- Runs asyncio code within Trio context using threads
- Supports both sync and async functions
- Proper event loop management
- Exception handling and propagation

## Testing

## Performance Benefits

### Structured Concurrency Advantages
- **Resource Safety**: Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks

- **Error Handling**: Exceptions are properly contained and handled
- **Debugging**: Clear task hierarchy makes debugging easier

### Efficiency Improvements
- **Cooperative Scheduling**: Better CPU utilization with cooperative multitasking
- **Memory Management**: Structured cleanup reduces memory usage
- **Process Management**: Efficient subprocess handling with proper termination
- **Scalability**: Better handling of concurrent job execution

## Integration Points

### Existing System Compatibility
- **RQ Integration**: Works with existing Redis Queue system
- **Job Queue**: Compatible with current job status and logging
- **Configuration**: Uses existing configuration merger and pipeline
- **GCS Upload**: Integrates with existing Google Cloud Storage uploader

### API Endpoints
- Job cancellation endpoints work with both Trio and threading modes
- Status polling reflects proper cancellation states
- Log streaming includes Trio-specific log messages
- Health checks include Trio executor status

## Usage Examples

### Basic Job Execution
```python
executor = get_trio_executor()
result = await executor.execute_job(job_id, job_function, timeout=3600)
```

### Job Cancellation
```python
success = executor.cancel_job(job_id)
if success:
    print("Job cancellation initiated")
```

### Resource Management
```python
async with trio_job_context(job_id) as (token, manager):
    token.add_cleanup_callback(cleanup_function)
    result = await execute_job_logic(token, manager)
```

### Process Management
```python
process = await manager.start_process(["command", "args"], timeout=300)
# Process automatically cleaned up on cancellation
```

## Configuration

### Trio Mode Selection
```python
# Use Trio (default)
result = process_video_job(job_id, use_trio=True)

# Use threading fallback
result = process_video_job(job_id, use_trio=False)
```

### Timeout Configuration
- Job execution timeout: Configurable per job (default: 3600 seconds)
- Process timeout: Configurable per subprocess (default: 300 seconds)
- Cancellation timeout: SIGTERM (5s) → SIGKILL (2s)

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging Integration
- Structured logging with job IDs and phases
- Cancellation events logged with context
- Process management events tracked
- Error conditions logged with stack traces

### Metrics Integration
- Active job tracking in Trio executor
- Cancellation success/failure rates
- Process termination statistics
- Resource cleanup metrics

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **HTTP/3 Integration**: Direct integration with Hypercorn's Trio support
- **Streaming Progress**: Real-time progress updates using Trio channels
- **Resource Limits**: Per-job resource limits with Trio monitoring
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Priority-based job scheduling with Trio nurseries

### Scalability Considerations
